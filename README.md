# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship
This repository showcases the deliverables and insights from the Data Analysis task of the Deloitte Australia Virtual Internship program. This project demonstrates the application of Business Intelligence (BI) skills to solve an operational efficiency problem for a major manufacturing client.
## 1. Business Context: Operational Risk Management
Client: Daikibo Industrials, a global heavy machinery manufacturer.   

Challenge: Daikibo had successfully unified one month of telemetry data (IoT sensor data) collected from their four global factories. The executive team needed immediate insights to address rising operational risks.

1- Which factory location (plant) experienced the highest machine downtime?    

2-What specific type of machine broke down most often in that highest-risk location?    

Role: Data Analyst / Business Intelligence Consultant (Deloitte Australia).
## 2. Technical Solution: Tableau Dashboard Development
Tool Used: Tableau Desktop    

Key Steps and Methodology:

1- Data Acquisition: Imported the aggregated telemetry data (daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip).   

 2- Calculated Measures: Created calculated fields within Tableau to accurately identify and aggregate machine statuses categorized as 'Unhealthy' or 'Stopped' (i.e., total downtime).   

3- Visualization: Built essential bar charts to visualize downtime aggregated by Factory and by Device Type.   

4- Dashboard Interactivity: Designed a single, interactive dashboard by connecting the Factory chart to the Machine Type chart, enabling quick filtering to isolate the most problematic machines within the highest-risk factory.   

5- Actionable Insight: The final dashboard identified the specific factory and machine type requiring immediate maintenance and resource allocation.
